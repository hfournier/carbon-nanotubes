          Long Carbon Nanotubes For Composites
        </h2>
        <p>
          At 30 times stronger than kevlar, our long carbon nanotubes are
          dispersable, workable, and ready for mixing into epoxies and plastics
          (as seen in the image above).
        </p>
        <p>
          Short carbon nanotubes (&lt;100 microns) pull out of expoxies and
          other materials. Long (1 mm to 2 cm), strong carbon nanotubes form a
          complete, intertwined mesh of support and can not pull out. Their
          strength is transferred to the matrix making it stiffer and stronger
          as well as electrically and thermally conductive.

          High-Strength Carbon Nanotube Threads

        <p>
          With our carbon nanotubes weâ€™ve started pushing commercial spinning of
          pure carbon nanotube threads that will have 100 gigapascals of tensile
          strength making continuous threads that are safe, strong, light,
          flexible, and have many applications across products and industries.

          The Material Of The Future
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Carbon nanotubes</strong> are one of the most innovative materials
          ever invented and stand ready to disrupt everything from tennis racquets
          to spacecraft, sailboat racing, aerospace, automotive, and far beyond.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-inside list-disc">
          <li>30x stronger than kevlar, 20x stronger than carbon fiber</li>
          <li>High chemical resistance</li>
          <li>Light-weight</li>
          <li>Readily workable</li>
          <li>Incredibly flexible</li>
          <li>Conductive or EM shielding</li>
          <li>From 1 mm up to 2 cm long</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Imagine a plane twice the size and half the weight of a 747, an
          untwistable golf club, an unbendable tennis racket, an inflatable
          space habitat system. Carbon nanotubes can enable each of these and
          more.
